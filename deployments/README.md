# Deployment Manifests

This directory contains deployment manifests for all EVOLVERSE / MEGAZION contracts.

## File Structure

- `<network>_latest.json` - Most recent deployment for the network
- `<network>_<timestamp>.json` - Historical deployment records

## Manifest Format

```json
{
  "network": "polygon",
  "chainId": 137,
  "deployedAt": "2025-11-02T13:10:00.000Z",
  "deployer": "0x...",
  "contracts": {
    "BLEULION_CASCADE": {
      "address": "0x...",
      "deploymentTx": "0x...",
      "blockNumber": 12345678
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage

Deployment manifests are automatically generated by `scripts/deploy_all_contracts.ts`.

To load a manifest in your scripts:

```typescript
import * as fs from "fs";
import * as path from "path";

const manifest = JSON.parse(
  fs.readFileSync(
    path.join(__dirname, "deployments", "polygon_latest.json"),
    "utf8"
  )
);

const cascadeAddress = manifest.contracts.BLEULION_CASCADE.address;
```

## Security Note

⚠️ These files contain public contract addresses only. Private keys are never stored here.
