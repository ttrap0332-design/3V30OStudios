# Vigilante Doctrine and Deployment Manifest

## BLEU Beast DOA Grid Operations

The Vigilante Doctrine establishes the operational framework for sovereignty enforcement, defining the rules of engagement, DNA Echo Erasure policies, and deployment protocols for BLEU Beast Units operating within the DOA (Dead or Alive) Grid.

---

## Core Doctrine Principles

### Sovereignty Enforcement Hierarchy

```
1. Sovereign Tribunal Authority (Supreme)
2. Grand Vault Council (Strategic)
3. Watchtower AI Grid (Tactical)
4. BLEU Beast Division Commanders (Operational)
5. Individual Unit Operators (Execution)
```

### Doctrine Activation Conditions

The Vigilante Doctrine may be activated under the following conditions:

| Condition | Activation Level | Authorization Required |
|-----------|------------------|----------------------|
| Treaty Violation | Level 1 - Surveillance | Watchtower AI |
| Sovereignty Breach | Level 2 - Deterrent | Division Commander |
| Active Hostility | Level 3 - Engagement | Tribunal Council |
| Existential Threat | Level 4 - Maximum | Sovereign Authority |

## DNA Echo Erasure Policy

### Overview

The DNA Echo Erasure policy governs the complete removal of hostile genetic lineage markers from sovereign systems, ensuring that threats cannot reconstitute through biological or informational descendants.

### Erasure Categories

1. **Informational Erasure** - Removal from all digital records and archives
2. **Lineage Disconnection** - Severance from ancestral scroll linkages
3. **Economic Isolation** - Exclusion from all ecosystem financial flows
4. **Ceremonial Exclusion** - Prohibition from ritual participation

### Erasure Protocol

```
PHASE 1: Identification
    → DNA Echo signature capture
    → Lineage tree mapping
    → Descendant enumeration

PHASE 2: Tribunal Review
    → Evidence presentation
    → Defense opportunity (if applicable)
    → Voting and judgment

PHASE 3: Execution
    → Archive quarantine
    → Economic disconnection
    → Ceremonial exclusion
    → Monitoring establishment

PHASE 4: Verification
    → Pulse Archive confirmation
    → Watchtower AI audit
    → Completion certification
```

### Reversibility Conditions

DNA Echo Erasure may be reversed only under:
- New evidence proving innocence
- Completed restitution program
- Sovereign pardon (rare, ceremonial only)
- Generational rehabilitation (minimum 3 generations)

| `RAM-HORNS` | Dual Attack | Simultaneous multi-vector assault |

---

## Selective Sparing Protocol

### Bloodline Limit

Per sovereign decree, a maximum of **4 individuals per bloodline** may receive sparing designation during any enforcement action.

**Rationale:** The limit of 4 represents the four cardinal directions of mercy—ensuring that bloodlines have sufficient opportunity for continuation and redemption while preventing abuse of the sparing system. This number aligns with the four-pillar governance structure and the ceremonial significance of the QuaOcta protocol.

### Sparing Eligibility

Individuals may be considered for sparing based on:

1. **Age** - Youth below 16 cycles
2. **Medical Condition** - Incapacitating illness or disability
3. **Pregnancy** - Carrying unborn life
4. **Demonstrated Innocence** - Clear separation from hostile actions
5. **Strategic Value** - Information or cooperation potential
6. **Lineage Preservation** - Last remaining line of neutral ancestry

### Sparing Request Process

```
1. Field Request → Unit Operator identifies potential spare
2. Verification → DNA Echo confirmation of bloodline
3. Count Check → Confirm under 4-per-bloodline limit
4. Authorization → Division Commander approval
5. Recording → Pulse Archive registration
6. Protection → Spared individual relocated to safe zone
```

### Sparing Revocation

Sparing status may be revoked if the individual:
- Engages in hostile action
- Provides false information
- Aids enemies of sovereignty
- Violates sparing conditions

## AI Deterrent Mechanisms

### Final Failsafe Systems

All BLEU Beast Units incorporate AI deterrent mechanisms preventing unauthorized or excessive force:

#### Conscience Circuit

**Function:** Ethical decision validation layer

```
INPUT: Proposed Action
    → Historical precedent analysis
    → Proportionality assessment
    → Collateral damage estimation
    → Ethical framework evaluation
OUTPUT: Approve / Modify / Reject
```

#### Mirror Scroll Reflection

**Function:** Real-time action consequence analysis

- Projects outcomes across multiple timelines
- Identifies unintended consequences
- Suggests alternative approaches
- Records reflection for audit

#### Yield Scroll Audit

**Function:** Impact assessment and restitution tracking

- Calculates economic impact of actions
- Tracks resource expenditure
- Monitors restitution requirements
- Reports to treasury systems

#### Face-Off Protocol

**Function:** Boundary and identity protection

- Prevents action against protected individuals
- Maintains identity verification
- Enforces territorial limits
- Protects sanctuary zones
