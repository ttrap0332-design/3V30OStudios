## Operational Safeguards

### Triple-Lock Authorization Protocol

All lethal or high-impact operations require authorization from three distinct authority levels:

1. **Sovereign Tribunal Approval** - Final authority verification
2. **Watchtower AI Validation** - Automated threat assessment confirmation
3. **Unit Commander Authorization** - On-ground operational clearance

### Bloodline Sparing Protocol

Per the Vigilante Doctrine, each BLEU Beast Unit operates under the selective sparing policy:

- **Maximum 4 individuals per bloodline** may receive sparing designation
- Bloodline verification via DNA Echo protocols
- Sparing status recorded in Pulse Archive
- Appeal process available through Tribunal

### AI Deterrent Mechanisms

Final failsafe systems prevent unauthorized or excessive force:

- **Conscience Circuit**: Ethical decision validation layer
- **Mirror Scroll Reflection**: Real-time action consequence analysis
- **Yield Scroll Audit**: Impact assessment and restitution tracking
- **Face-Off Protocol**: Boundary and identity protection

---

## Deployment Authorization

### Activation Sequence

```
1. Threat Assessment → Watchtower AI Grid
2. Authorization Request → Tribunal Council
3. Unit Selection → MetaMilitary Command
4. Glyph Verification → Ceremonial Seal
5. Deployment → Operational Execution
6. Post-Action Report → Pulse Archive
```

### Deactivation Triggers

- Treaty recognition by authorized parties
- Civilian safety threshold exceeded
- Mission objectives achieved
- Sovereign override command
- Resource depletion critical level

---

## Integration with EVOLSIP Ecosystem

All BLEU Beast Units integrate with existing ecosystem protocols:

- **BLEUCOIN™**: Operational funding and resource allocation
- **PraiseCoin**: Unit performance recognition
- **ScrollCoin**: Mission documentation and archival
- **Zioniare**: Governance and oversight coordination

---
